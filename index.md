Hello, I'm Lorrens, currently a master's student at [UHasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en).
I like compilers and databases, but I'm interested in anything related to Computer Science. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/LorrensP-2158466) or send me an [email](mailto:lorrens.pantelis+blog@student.uhasselt.be).

I'm currently a GSoC contributor for the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), working on the [Parallel Macro Expansion project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/SBW3GMno).
You can follow this work on [zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/421156-gsoc/topic/Project.3A.20Parallel.20Macro.20Expansion/with/520828188), but I'll occasionally post something here (main reason this blog exists). 

Other things I like:

- Working out
- (Belgian) Beer
- Physics and friends
